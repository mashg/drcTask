# React/TypeScript interview test

### The mission

Enhance this poorly coded little application and try to fix the following points: 

**🪲 Bugs**\
The application has a few bugs. Find and resolve them!

**️📦 Reusability**\
`Table` should work with any kind of data, not only `User`.

**🏎 Performance**\
Consider that the application could be led to work with dozens of thousands of rows. In its current state, it is not performance enough to face this load. Try to optimize the performance by any means possible!

**✅ Typing**\
Remove as much `any` as possible. Force correctness of `Table` parameters. 
In short use all the power of _TypeScript_ to ensure code safety. 


### Notes

This code faces a huge amount of issues, some of which could be hard to find. 
Don't worry if you don't find everything; simply do your best. 
Feel free to build something significantly different, but ensure the existing features work:

- Limiting rows
- Searching by ID
- Cell edition
- Sorting by a given column

Also, feel free to showcase your CSS skills 🙂.

⚠️ The file [api-readonly-file.ts](src%2Fapi-readonly-file.ts) simulates an API call. Don't edit it.
